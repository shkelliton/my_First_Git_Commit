## Abstract
This experiment will test to see how effective StoryMaps is at recording an event primarily recorded on social media. While a historical event typically has specific recorded events and dates, this experiment will view the event through a social media lens. The chosen sources are the subreddit r/Ottawa, popular Twitter hashtags during the event, and news articles. Using StoryMaps location services will create a greater visual impact and help the viewer understand the scale and the true origins of the 2022 “Freedom Convoy”.
This experiment furthers the discussion with the use of Voyant Tools, inputting articles that  cover the event in order to visualize the main ideas presented by said media coverage. Voyant Tool’s data visualization and trend mapping will allow for a overall appraisal of the main ideas presented through news coverage. 

## Part 1 - StoryMaps

### Introduction

The focus of this paper is to use and analyze StoryMaps and its effectiveness in compiling information from highly publicized events. The specific event being addressed is the ‘Freedom Convoy’ of 2022’s origins and residence in Ottawa. The primary sources used were news articles, the subreddit r/Ottawa, Tweets, and Twitter hashtags. StoryMaps was used to show influence from external sources, the event from a social media lens and official news coverage.   

Observing an event from a social media lens can be useful for piecing together a timeline and the scope of the event. In Real-World Behavior Analysis through a Social Media Lens, the authors used a large quantity of Tweets to attempt to determine attitude, key people, and overall sentiments shared. While the analysis provided good data for the categories mentioned above, the authors were unable to predict events before they happened, stating “This example and many others show that even we (sic) collect enough data from social media and run sophisticated algorithm to analyze social media data, we would not be able to predict the real-world’s outcome” (Abbasi et al., 2012). As such, Twitter can be used for recording key figures and overall sentiments but not currently as a predictor for future events. This experiment uses key people and addresses sentiments interpreted through hashtags on twitter.


### Methods

i.	Participants
a.	Convoy participants
i.	Many convoy participants used Twitter to encourage other participants, express anti-vaccine sentiments, and to disparage the Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Videos of the convoy were also frequently posted on Twitter. The primary trending hashtag used by these participants was #TrudeauTyranny. 
b.	Ottawa Residents & Critics of the Convoy
i.	Ottawa Residents and Convoy Critics used Twitter to express frustration and distaste for convoy participants. The Ottawa residents and Convoy critics also posted videos and there was a high focus on “Ottawa Heroes” talking back to the Convoy. The primary trending hashtag used by these participants was #FluTruxKlan.
ii.	Apparatus and Materials
a.	StoryMap
i.	StoryMap was used to visualize incidents around the city and organize based on theme. One color was used for the Convoy participants and one for the “Ottawa Heroes”. The location tags were useful for showcasing where the Convoy originated and emphasize that some influences were not within Ontario. 
b.	Twitter and Reddit
i.	Twitter was the source for many of the videos included in the StoryMap. The subreddit r/Ottawa also contained many videos and discussion threads set up specifically for the Convoy situation.
c.	News Articles
i.	News articles were used in order to provide context from less biased sources than the Twitter hashtags. The direct links within StoryMaps to the news articles do not format quite as nicely as the Tweets, so images should be used as the slide content instead. 
iii.	Procedure
a.	Social Media Events
i.	Searching by date and within hashtags helped find the primary incidents reported from the Freedom Convoy’s time in Ottawa. Incidents are color coded and organized in groups.
b.	Date and Locate
i.	The slides were organized by date within the theme groups and, if possible, located on the map. The map is used to show the scope of the protests and the web of counter-protestors. Influence from outside of Ontario is also able to be shown and emphasized. The dates are included on each slide. 

### Results

Overall, StoryMaps was effective in showing the scope and influence of the 2022 Freedom Convoy from a social media and reported media perspective. Being able to go from counter protestor incident to counter protestor incident was effective in showcasing the response of Ottawa residents. 

The map marker feature, while useful, was difficult to implement properly for this event specifically because of lack of information on where an event occurred. Specifically in the “Ottawa Heroes” section, locations had to be separated manually due to the anonymity of the videos used as reference. While Twitter can be used to find locations, it is difficult to find the original videos to reference. 

The automatic formatting of Tweets worked well for this project as Tweets and Twitter hashtags were a heavy focus. Being able to include direct links to Tweets added a layer of validity and personal connection. For verified accounts and accounts known to be connected to actual people, StoryMaps can format the Tweets and the user can input the location tag from the Tweet itself. 

A feature that would have helped in this experiment would be a specific section to include dates if needed. While this is a small point, being able to include dates would help with timelines and that feature would be useful across a wide breadth of projects. It also would be useful to have a non-located or default blank background slide to break up the sections with headers or contextual text blocks. Without a chosen location, StoryMaps also struggles to go between slides while keeping the map on screen (Fig. 1 &2). 

For the story being told, StoryMaps was effective in showcasing the resistance of Ottawa citizens to the Freedom Convoy. It also works well for cohesively containing what can be considered a historical event. Having the user experience the distance between Ottawa and external influences visually - such as the Ohio man potentially attempting to tie up police resources - creates a larger impact than just reading the article itself. In a world with a global, interconnected community, realizing the magnitude of the distance is important to understanding local issues.

## Part 2 - Voyant Tools

### Methods

i.	Participants
a.	The participants in this study were mostly the same as those for the StoryMaps section, however this section uses entirely news articles. The articles were not chosen based off of intellectual merit, reporting integrity, or lack of bias. Any article covering the event is valuable to creating an overall picture of the event in how it was presented to the general public.  
ii.	Apparatus and Materials
a.	Voyant Tools
i.	Voyant Tools was the primary tool used in this section as it was organizing the data for study. The cirrus cloud, term trends, termsberry, and term links are all very useful parts of Voyant Tools. 
b.	News Articles
i.	Any news articles covering the event were considered useful in this experiment as it is meant purely as an analysis of media focus and presentation to the general public. 
iii.	Procedure
a.	The first step for this experiment was to collect news articles that covered the event while it was happening. Wikipedia had compiled a timeline of the event, which was a good source for a larger selection of articles to access. Using this resource along with other articles sourced, a list was compiled to make inputting into Voyant Tools easier. 
b.	The articles were then sorted by month in order to compartmentalize what topics were being covered at what time. In addition to making the topics easier to analyze, Voyant Tools was unable to handle a large volume of articles inputted at the same time.

### Results

<strong>CONVOY BEGINNINGS</strong>

<iframe style='width: 100%; height: 800px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/?panels=corpusterms%2Creader%2Cdocumentterms%2Csummary%2Cbubblelines&corpus=6a4e1e0b0adb58e33a1cd24c4d5cb8fb'></iframe>

The common themes of these articles are on ‘security’, ‘border’, ‘drivers’, ‘covid’, ‘mandate’, ‘U.S.’, and ‘vaccine’, shown by the generated cirrus word cloud. Through this cloud, the main issue at this point in time can be considered the covid vaccine mandates and truck drivers having issues at the border. In the terms trend block, the mentions of ‘U.S.’ has a heavy influence on one article but minimal in any of the other articles. ‘Security’ is relevant to both the covid vaccine mandate and the truck driver border issues. Additionally, the word cloud includes that ‘says’ is included 25 times and ‘said’ is included 24 times. This could mean references or quotes from the general public, government, or health officials are being used frequently in articles concerning the Freedom Convoy. 

<strong>JANUARY</strong>

<iframe style='width: 100%; height: 800px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/?panels=cirrus%2Ctermsberry%2Cdocumentterms%2Cphrases%2Cbubblelines&corpus=8397fce78cd59043f5bac5083b5702d8'></iframe>

For the month of January, the common themes of the articles are ‘Ottawa’, ‘police’, ‘convoy’, ‘downtown’, ‘protesters/protest’, and ‘continues’. ‘Said’ was included in the articles a total of 210 times, whereas ‘freedom’ was included 56 times. In the case of ‘said’, the term links connected the phrase primarily to ‘police’, ‘chief’, ‘city’, ‘Ottawa’, and ‘Sunday’. The implication is of most quotes are coming from the Ottawa Police and City of Ottawa. ‘Convoy’ finds its only connection with ‘Ottawa’. The comparatively low usage of ‘freedom’ within the articles implies that the representation of the Freedom Convoy is likely just as the Convoy. Alternatively, the usage of ‘freedom’ could be intentionally used sparingly to avoid conveying support. 

<strong>FEBRUARY</strong>

<iframe style='width: 100%; height: 800px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/?panels=cirrus%2Ctermsberry%2Cdocumentterms%2Cdocuments%2Ccontexts&corpus=becb3ddefba528a0cbfeb854eac1e9b4'></iframe>

For the month of January, the common themes of the articles are ‘police’, ‘Ottawa’, ‘protest/protesters’, ‘convoy’, ‘government’, and ‘Canada’. Once again, ‘said’ is featured at a high volume, coming in at 337 mentions. ‘Said’ finds connections with ‘Thursday’, ‘Police’, ‘health’, and ‘Ottawa’. Similarly to January, the quotes are likely coming from the Ottawa police, with the new implication being quotes possibly coming from health Canada. ‘Protestors’ and ‘Police’, representing the clashes that occurred between the Ottawa Police and Freedom Convoy Protesters. ‘Freedom’ appeared 57 times in the 39 articles and at too low a quantity to appear in the cirrus word cloud or the term links.


## Discussion

StoryMaps is useful for recording current events and has excellent, readable formatting options but using these direct links lacks longevity. Tweets can change and be deleted and news articles become updated and archived with time. If using images exclusively or links to an internet archive, further longevity can be achieved but the special features available wouldn’t work as ways to preserve content. 
For older, non-digitally occurring historical events, StoryMaps would be an excellent way to preserve a story. Additionally, recording an event that exists heavily on social media already has some level of difficulty in verifying sources regardless of potential broken links. Overall, the formatting services are excellent but not suited to this type of project. 

The lack of a date feature hinders this project as well. While the locations help tell the story of where information has come from and where events occurred, without a timeline the event is difficult to navigate and format. The dates were included in the blurbs below the content but are not all formatted the same, making readability difficult. 

This project was unconventional due to it focusing entirely on what was represented online very recently rather than an event with concrete information, it utilizes StoryMaps location services to create an event map. This event was one that can not be entirely contained into one digital tool. 

Using Voyant Tools, however, did help fill in thematic blanks for areas of the event portrayed through the media that may have seemed scattered otherwise. Having the general theme of the event helps show the consumer the overall intent of articles. From the beginnings of the convoy to the events in January and February, police and government involvement increased. The difference in implied police involvement from January to February is a subject of interest as it can show the nature of a protest led by a group considered privileged.  

In The Dark Side of the Digital Humanities, the authors write that their critique “takes aim at the larger project of rewriting political and pedagogical problems into technological ones, into problems that technology can fix” (Chun et al., 2016). This idea fits this project in the sense that this broad and ongoing political issue is not something that can currently be solved by technology. Even if the information can all be placed into the StoryMap in a concise, accurate way, users from either side of the discussion will still read through it subjectively. This is also the case with Voyant Tools, as many interpretations can be gleaned from the available data visualizations. Any bias from the news articles, the subreddit r/Ottawa, and Twitter will be either heavily exaggerated or completely ignored depending on the viewer.
