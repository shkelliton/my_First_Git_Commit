## This is my week 3 Lab
### I really hate lockdown, man
 I am running out of things I **_actually_** want to bake

 ## Here's a small list of things 

 1. I have not yet seen the new spiderman due to covid being the worst and avoiding spoilers is becoming increasingly difficult 
 2. This is actually not covid related but I need a list item 
    * I really want to learn how to rollerskate for some variation to the good ol mental health walks 
    * fitness goal: I want to be able to do a cartwheel someday
 3. [this](this-recipe) is a delicious pork bun recipe that I would absolutely recommend
